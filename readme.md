# Okay, no.

The above was written by GPT. I'm not a student of the 3rd year of the Faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science of the Belarusian State University. Luckily, or unfortunately.

BUt I am interested in AI and in Mobile & Web apps.

## What is this project about?

This is a simple game to see if you are better than GPT in conquering countries.

## How is it made?

Decoupled web app. 

Front-end (/client) is made with Ionic and uses Vue.

Back-end (/server) is made using nodejs and Nestjs as the framework.

## How to run it?

Like any other Ionic and Nestjs apps. Maybe the default readme-s of the apps will help, see the directories.

## Contibute?

Sure, why not. Just make a PR or create an issue. 

## Known issues

Several, but the most important one is that the game is not finished. But I will try to create GitHub issues once I have released the first playable version.

## License

Do whatever you want. I don't care. Just don't blame me if you get in trouble. Vue, Ionic and Nestjs follow MIT I believe, didnt check yet.

## Credits

To my wife & kids for not killing me while I was working on this project. Also to all the developers who have made the tech I used in this project available for me to have fun with it. And also thanks to OpenAI, it's been fun to play with GPT.
